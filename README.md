= Stadia Controller Bluetooth Updater =

== About ==
This is a local copy of the Stadia bluetooth update tool.
The reason for creating this is so that the tool can be preserved long after the site is removed in December 2023.

Please note: For this to work you do need to run chrome with the flags `--allow-file-access-from-files` because of a CORS error.

== TODO: ==
[ ] Add in a way to be able to self-server this without needing the flag.
[ ] Find the files `gotham_dvt_a_dev_signed.bin`, `gotham_dvt_a_stage_signed.bin` and `gotham_pvt_a_prod_signed.bin` since these are referenced and are the WiFi-based firmware.
